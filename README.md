# Ad Videos Sentiment Analysis: Logistic Regression, TF-IDF, and Predictive Analytics
This project applies Logistic Regression and TF-IDF vectorization to analyze and classify sentiment in video advertisements based on textual data. The dataset includes ad descriptions, transcriptions, and on-screen text, which are processed to predict answers to 21 binary sentiment-related questions. The results are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to provide actionable insights into the effectiveness of video ads.
